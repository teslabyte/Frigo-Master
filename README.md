# Frigo-Master

Frigo-Master is a simple project written in Java and Spring Boot that allows users to manage customer data. With this tool, users can add or delete customers, search for customers, edit customers, and restore them. The main function of this project was to help me learn Spring Boot and MongoDB.  
  **Features** 

 - Add customers: With Frigo-Master, users can add new customers by filling out a form with the customer's name, address, phone number.

 - Delete customers: Users can delete customers from the database by searching for the customer by name and selecting the "delete" option.

 - Search for customers: Users can search for customers by name or email address. The search function returns a list of all customers that match the search criteria.

 - Edit customers: Users can edit customer information by selecting the customer from the search results and modifying the customer's information.

 - Restore customers: Frigo-Master allows users to restore deleted customers. Deleted customers are stored in a separate database and can be restored to the main database if needed.

**Requirements** 

    Java 8 or higher
    Spring Boot 2.4.4 or higher
    MongoDB 4.4 or higher
